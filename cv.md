### About Me
Four year ago I wanted to work in EPAM. I studied CSS, HTML, JS myself on the FeeCodeCamp, but my English level was A2. 
Then I worked in the small company, where I learned React+Redux and React Native myself and created app for cargo transportation in React Native. 

After this experience I had to take a break due to the birth of my lovely children. 
In this time I improved my English skills and I was able to pass the IELTS for B1 level.

All time I was dreaming to work in EPAM, where I can creat amazing applications, because I like find solutions to various problems. 
Also in this company I would develop different hard and skills, such as  communication, team work and learn new technologies.
I like create complex and useful application, because it can help many people.

### Code Example
#### Create Phone Number from CODEWARS
*Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.*
***Example:***
```
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
*The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!*
```
function createPhoneNumber(numbers){ <br />
  let a = ""; <br />
  let b = "";<br />
  let c = "";<br />
  a = numbers.splice(0, 3).join('');<br />
  b = numbers.splice(0, 3).join('');<br />
  c = numbers.join('');<br />
  return "(" + a + ")" + " " + b + "-" + c;<br />
}
